## Overview
I'm a person, not a robot, who has worked in multiple industries from hospitality to retail and more recently construction, I've done everything from cleaning fish gut off the floor to hitting my hand with a hammer on accident obviously, and I'm now looking to the future and searching for a job in Software Development. I'm a visual thinker and right now I'm seeing the world as a game of Pac-Man and I've just eaten a power pellet, so in other words, I'm gonna eat them ghosts. The main thing is I'm good with people, particular about my work and methodical.
#####
I liked moving around to keep things interesting which is why I was drawn to software development there's always something new, plenty to learn and more than enough chances to keep my skills sharp, there's also a large active community which makes getting help a lot easier. I've worked with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript using a MEN(Mongo, Express and Node.js).
#####
I've worked in a lot of different places so I'm sort of a jack of all trades, and now hopefully, I'm a master of one. 
 
## Skills

#### Ambitious
During my time working in Sarah's Restaurant, I was given a lot of tasks such as baking the bread, checking deliveries, maintaining a high level of cleanliness, preparing fish, oysters and vegetables and keeping stock. Over the summer I worked there I earned a raise which I was proud of and I also learned things about baking and wine because I took an interest in it and I was eager to learn.

#### Analytical Skills
I also had to do some problem solving working in carpentry doing joists, but in these situations, I would be given a drawing to work from, I'd have to work out where stairs would go based on where the front door and back doors where and also using a bit of commonsense, stairs wouldn’t overlap a window, for example, once I had that worked that I can start laying out the joists before you start nailing anything this would always give me a chance to double-check I'm right before nailing anything, because once you start nailing its a mess to undo it. 

#### Organisational skills
While I was doing carpentry, mainly building roofs or joists, I would also have to crane roofs. Occasionally the person I was doing my apprenticeship under would give me a chance to decide where the trusses would go and how to unload it. This was quite a difficult task at the beginning because the trusses would sometimes be slightly different on the front and the back and sometimes be the same so I had to keep my eye out for that. I'd have to find room on the scaffolding for all the smaller trusses and timbers as well, it was almost like a game of Tetris. The best way of doing it was by putting the variety timbers down first and in a convenient place because we'd be using them a lot. Then place the trusses on the wooden plates on the walls so they could be spread out later, because of the size of these trusses we'd need to brace them so they didn’t tip. Then the rest would be put around the side of the scaffolding because they wouldn’t be needed till later on. Having a well-organised workplace made life a lot easier because the chances of you falling were slim.


#### Problem-Solving Skills
While working in retail in a shop called "Dunnes Store" I was tasked with managing the crisps and sweets aisle which were the least favourite aisles among my colleges due to the flimsy nature of the packaging. Unfortunately, I was stuck with these aisles during my time working there so I had to find a workaround to keep my managers happy I could just pack the shelves out the brim but that wasn't a reliable way of solving the problem because there would be days where there was little to no stock for certain items, I noticed that they could be prompted to stay up if they were given additional support from at least another 2-3 packets which were almost always available, after being fluffed the aisle looked like a flush wall. My manager complimented me on how good it looked and keep me in these aisles because I was the best at stocking crisps.

#### Teamwork
In a lot of the places that I worked in being teamwork played a key role in my job. For example, I was working in a team when I worked in a place called Sarah's Restaurant, which was a restaurant and takeaway. I was usually put in a team when managing the takeaway with the help of my colleagues. I was given the reigns most of the time, but we had to decide how we'd do it together. Who would take the order, who would cook the food and decide which foods were to be cooked first to ensure everything was delivered hot. We didn't have many angry customers which meant we must’ve worked well together.

## Education

#### Why didn't I go to university?
I decided not to jump on the college train main because I wanted to try different jobs before settling and college seemed to be setting me on a track that would be difficult to get off, so I got out there and started giving CV's to every place that would take them which got me my first job. Although this place only opened over summer so it was temporary. But it started me on a track of getting experience in a variety of areas, which helped me grow as a person and to understand and respect the people who do these jobs day in day out.

#### Other courses
I've also done online courses on Udemy covering HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I've also used Bootstrap and Semantic UI to add styling and JavaScript functions, used DOM manipulation to manipulate styles, I've used a NoSQL database, Mongo, and frameworks like Express and Node.js.

## Experience

**Sarah's Restaurant** (9/June/2016 to 8/Oct/2016)
Kitchen Porter/Waiter

I did a lot of different work here a learned a lot because this was my first real job, this was my foundation for building skills like communication skills, through the people I would meet through the takeaway as well as people I'd meet later on as a waiter, and team working, due to the fact I was working in conjunction with up to three other kitchen porters or wait staff we'd have to tell each other which tables were waiting on food and who had been served ect., It also taught me to work under pressure and to deadline, the chef would need certain items for certain times and we'd have to be finished up by 12:00, and also learning to prioritise things, I'd wash the items the chef used the most first and if we ere low on plates I'd make them a priority.

**JS Carpentry** (Dec/2018 to Aug/2019)
Apprentice Carpenter

I got a chance to try something new here and to build on my organisational skills through keeping a clean and manageable workspace, problem-solving skills through facing and overcoming the new array of challenges, and communication skills through dealing with the different workers I'd be helping and getting help from.

## Hobbies
- Jiu-Jitsu - It's enjoyable keeps you fit and teaches respect which is a good attitude to have to keep you out of trouble and if that doesn't work you can use it as a last resort.
- Puzzle/Strategy Games - They're frustrating at time although that makes them all the more rewarding when you solve them plus it's a great thing to do with friends.
- Blogging(https://dev.to/kealanheena) - I knew it'd be challenging(mainly due to the fact my writing skills aren't great), I found it strangly relaxing and enjoy working on it, plus it give me a chance to improve my writing skill.
- Photography - I really enjoy a beautiful view so why not try to capture those views and share them with others plus I like to travel so it's nice to compare different places
